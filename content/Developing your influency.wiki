= Developing your influency =

A long time ago I gave a tech talk about Influency.
My experience in this topic comes mostly from three books: How to win friends and Influence people by Dale Carnegie, The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen R. Covey and the Holy Bible (you cannot deny the influence power the Bible had in our society ;) )

I'll not describe the deck here as each slide deserves a note. Some day I'll write more about it.
