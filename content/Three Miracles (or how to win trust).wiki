= Three Miracles (or how to win trust) =

In the Catholic Church to be considered a saint the person must have performed 3 _verified_ miracles.
In my experience the same happens to professionals who enter a new environment.


Unless the person is already considered a saint by the public community, the person must perform up to 3 miracles to be considered a saint in the new environment.


Once you become a saint, people will listen to you.
But remember: With great power, comes great responsibility.
