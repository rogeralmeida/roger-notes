I first came accross this Kent Beck talk at Pivotal:

He got my attention when he mentioned that he could be _wrong_

This talk triggered a line of thinking interesting about the Life Cycle of a [[Digital Product]]

=== Overview ===
Kent explains that a product will go through 3 distinct phases:
* eXplore
* eXpand
* eXtract

=== eXplore ===
=== eXpand ===
=== eXtract ===

== Dimensions ==
=== Engineering Organisation ===
=== Techinical Solution ===
=== Product Vision ===
=== Product Support ===
=== Go To Market ===
