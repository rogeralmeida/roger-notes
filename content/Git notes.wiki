== Website to understand git "areas" ==
Two teams in a previous company decided to give git a try. So in the last weeks I have expend sometime talking about DVCS. One item that I have seen that is difficult to understand about git is that it has many "areas".
To explain the movement of changes between the areas normally I draw a picture in a paper with many arrows, showing the movement of changes for each git command...
Gladly I found the site that taught me this: http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html
If you have to explain any git command to someone, definitely I recommend you to use this site.
