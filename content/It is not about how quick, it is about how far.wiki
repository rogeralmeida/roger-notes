= It is not about how quick, it is about how far =

It's quite common to some business/manager people come to us and say:

    I'm trying to find ways to increase our production capacity... I would like to go faster. How quick can we  go? (...)

The point is: Software development is not about how quick, but about how far.
We always should think about how long our current solution will survive.
