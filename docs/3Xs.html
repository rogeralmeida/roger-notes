<p>
I first came accross this Kent Beck talk at Pivotal:
</p>
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX2XR73LnRY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
He got my attention when he mentioned that he could be <em>wrong</em>
</p>

<p>
This talk triggered a line of thinking interesting about the Life Cycle of a <a href="Digital Product.html">Digital Product</a>
</p>

<div id="Triple X-Overview"><h3 id="Overview" class="header"><a href="#Triple X-Overview">Overview</a></h3></div>
<p>
Kent explains that a product will go through 3 distinct phases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
eXplore

<li>
eXpand

<li>
eXtract

</ul>

<div id="Triple X-eXplore"><h3 id="eXplore" class="header"><a href="#Triple X-eXplore">eXplore</a></h3></div>
<p>
A new product starts as an idea.
For it to become a real product it has to find a <a href="Product Market Fit.html">Product Market Fit</a>.
But before find a Product Market Fit, an idea has to find a <a href="Product Solution Fit.html">Product Solution Fit</a>.
For weeks, months and sometimes even years, the day to day of a product team will be based on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>What are the features that our potential customers want?</em>

<li>
<em>What else would our current users want?</em>

<li>
<em>How can we reduce the customer turnover?</em>

</ul>

<p>
True to be said, this questions will probably persist during the whole life cycle of a product. But during the <span id="Triple X-eXplore-eXplore"></span><strong id="eXplore">eXplore</strong> phase these questions dominate the product conversation.
</p>

<p>
This reallity will last for as long as it needs to last, but as Kent says, at some moment the priority will change.
One day during the stand-up someone will mention that scale is the new priority. At that moment, the product is moving to the <span id="Triple X-eXplore-eXpand"></span><strong id="eXpand">eXpand</strong> phase.
</p>

<div id="Triple X-eXpand"><h3 id="eXpand" class="header"><a href="#Triple X-eXpand">eXpand</a></h3></div>
<p>
In the <span id="Triple X-eXpand-eXpand"></span><strong id="eXpand">eXpand</strong> phase the product is expanding.
Is general there is some resource that will not scale at the required velocity, unless some work is done.
</p>

<p>
It is very common for this resource to be a technical resource: <em>a database</em> , <em>memory</em>, <em>queues and dead letter queues</em>, <em>etc...</em>
But it can be non technical resources as well. For instance: <em>customer support</em>, <em>Sales team</em>, <em>project team</em>, <em>partnerships</em>, <em>etc...</em>
</p>

<p>
During this phase the top priority is not to include new features anymore, instead we talk about how to bring the existing features to more users. True to be said, there will still be new features, but they will not be the top priority.
</p>

<p>
The <span id="Triple X-eXpand-eXpand"></span><strong id="eXpand">eXpand</strong> phase can last for years. A product can go from a local niche to a global platform.
Until one day the expansions slows down and then, expanding is not the top priority anymore. Instead, the focus becomes on how to reduce the operational cost for the same product. At that moment the new phase has started <span id="Triple X-eXpand-eXtract"></span><strong id="eXtract">eXtract</strong>
</p>

<div id="Triple X-eXtract"><h3 id="eXtract" class="header"><a href="#Triple X-eXtract">eXtract</a></h3></div>
<p>
During the <span id="Triple X-eXtract-eXtract"></span><strong id="eXtract">eXtract</strong> phase the mantra is: <em>How can we do more with less?</em>
In the <span id="Triple X-eXtract-eXtract"></span><strong id="eXtract">eXtract</strong> phase a product focus on how to reduce the cost of maintaining and running the product.
