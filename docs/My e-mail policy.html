When I was working for <a href="[http://www.atos.html">Atos</a>, the company's CEO started a <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/home/we-are/zero-email.html">zero email initiative</a>. His aim was for the employees not to use email for internal communications. I remembered what I thought about it: "It's impossible".
Now I believe that he was right.
This post explains how I deal with my professional email inbox.
</p>

<div id="My e-mail policy-Keep email closed"><h2 id="Keep email closed" class="header"><a href="#My e-mail policy-Keep email closed">Keep email closed</a></h2></div>

<p>
I don't keep my email inbox open during the working hours. I open it just when I have to. I also disabled the email notification in my cellphone. That prevents me from check email whatever I see that a new email arrived.
</p>

<div id="My e-mail policy-Schedule time to check email"><h2 id="Schedule time to check email" class="header"><a href="#My e-mail policy-Schedule time to check email">Schedule time to check email</a></h2></div>
<p>
I check my email twice a day, at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm. I have reminders in my calendar . That helps me organize my day and prevents me from being fooled by my weak memory.

<p>
As an adopter of the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> I keep track of the time I spend with email. What I noticed is that I need almost two pomodoros  to read/respond/forward/archive my emails. That means that I need almost two hours during my day only to deal with my email inbox.  That was so true when I was working for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. Now that I'm working for <a href="http://dius.com.au/">DiUS</a> I'm trying not to sign in to so many email lists. My aim is to keep my email time in one pomodoro.

Up until here I've described what I have been doing for one year. It's working fine and I've noticed that my productive increased since then. Before I was checking email every time I alternated windows. Now, I can alternate windows without the temptation of checking email. But there is one last step that  I wanna try...
</p>

<div id="My e-mail policy-Vacation Responder On"><h2 id="Vacation Responder On" class="header"><a href="#My e-mail policy-Vacation Responder On">Vacation Responder On</a></h2></div>
<p>
From today on I'll keep my Vacation Responder On in my professional email. This is the message that I will send to those who send me email:
</p>

<p>
  Hi,
  This is a auto-reply to inform you about my email policy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I keep my email inbox closed during the working hours;

<li>
I also disabled email notifications in my cellphone;

<li>
I check email only at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm.
  If you need to contact me before my email times, feel free to reach me by phone: <span class="todo">XXX</span> <span class="todo">XXX</span> <span class="todo">XXX</span>. If you prefer you can use Whatsapp or Viber with this number as well.

</ul>

<p>
I wanted to try it for a long time, but never had courage to actually turn it on. I'll use it for some time, and depending on the feedback I will keep it or not. Who knows, maybe it can became a new post.
</p>

This is not my idea, I read about it at <a href="http://vidaorganizada.com/comece/dicas/2-dicas-incriveis-de-produtividade-que-mudaram-minha-vida/">Vida Organizada</a> (pt_br only).
