<p>
In the Catholic Church to be considered a saint the person must have performed 3 <em>verified</em> miracles.
In my experience the same happens to professionals who enter a new environment.

Unless the person is already considered a saint by the public community, the person must perform up to 3 miracles to be considered a saint in the new environment.

Once you become a saint, people will listen to you.
But remember: With great power, comes great responsibility.
