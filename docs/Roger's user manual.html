<p>
This page captures my style, thinking process and how to better interact with me. The intention is to have a place where I can point people to when they want to learn how to better collaborate with me.
</p>

<div id="My Style"><h1 id="My Style" class="header"><a href="#My Style">My Style</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
I have been a developer since 2002. I love to code. In my free time normally I'm <a href="https://github.com/rogeralmeida">coding something new</a> just for the pleasure of coding.

<li>
Like all good developers, I'm lazy! I want to do the minimum necessary and, if possible, automate it somehow. I adopt this philosofy even for non-code related tasks.

<li>
I'm a practitioner of visual management. And I prefer <a href="Information radiators vs Information refrigerators.html">Information radiators vs Information refrigerators</a> .

<li>
I like to ask questions. Questions are my favourite tool of engagement. Sometimes people perceive my questions as challenges. Most of the time <span id="My Style-they are not challenges"></span><strong id="they are not challenges">they are not challenges</strong>, they are just my way of keeping my brain focused on the topic.

</ul>
<p>
Other times they are nudges to guide people to a place that I believe is important to visit.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If I have a challenge for the idea discussed, I would say it without a question. E.g. "That doesn't sound good to me", "I disagree", "Maybe is better if...", etc.

<li>
I believe that a good team is a team that is prepared for the challenges ahead.

</ul>
<p>
So I focus on "How can my team be \[prepared|better prepared\] for this \[challenge|project|task\]
</p>

<div id="What I value"><h1 id="What I value" class="header"><a href="#What I value">What I value</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What I value-I value transparency over power"></span><strong id="I value transparency over power">I value transparency over power</strong>. I like to be transparent with the people around me and I expect that as well.

</ul>
<p>
I like to be as transparent as possible, to the level of saying: "<span id="What I value-I know more about it but I cannot disclose it yet"></span><strong id="I know more about it but I cannot disclose it yet">I know more about it but I cannot disclose it yet</strong>"
I believe that transparency requires maturity, that means that if I share a piece of information with you I expect you to be mature enough to handle it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="What I value-I value relationships over &quot;efficiency at all cost&quot;"></span><strong id="I value relationships over &quot;efficiency at all cost&quot;">I value relationships over "efficiency at all cost"</strong>. I spend more time with people inside the company than with my family during the week. So I want to create reasons to smile when I see you and vice-versa.

<li>
<span id="What I value-I value agreement over consensus"></span><strong id="I value agreement over consensus">I value agreement over consensus</strong>. I like people who have different opinions, but we must be able to agree on something and move forward.

<li>
<span id="What I value-I value servant leadership over the champions"></span><strong id="I value servant leadership over the champions">I value servant leadership over the champions</strong>. I prefer good team players, who are willing to work as a team than some excellent professional who has to work alone.

<li>
<span id="What I value-I value conflict not combat"></span><strong id="I value conflict not combat">I value conflict not combat</strong>. I have this tendency to keep people who have different opinions close to me. I believe they can help me cover my blindsides.

</ul>

<div id="What I don't have patience for"><h1 id="What I don't have patience for" class="header"><a href="#What I don't have patience for">What I don't have patience for</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
People who believe they know everything.

<li>
Disrespect with other people's struggles.

<li>
People who cannot demonstrate empathy.

<li>
Low quality work. (Quality is not negotiable)

</ul>

<div id="How to best communicate with me"><h1 id="How to best communicate with me" class="header"><a href="#How to best communicate with me">How to best communicate with me</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
Face to face &gt; Video &gt; Voice &gt; Audio message &gt; Text Message/Whatsapp &gt; ask someone to talk to me &gt; e-mail

<li>
Avoid irony. With English as a second language I still far from understanding irony in English.

<li>
Start with the headline. Be straight. Don't be afraid that I will take your point as an aggression. I'm good at receiving feedback.

<li>
I like to give space to people to explain their point of view, and I expect the same. If I could listen to you for a few minutes, I believe you can do it as well.

<li>
If you want to move me, give me a question instead of an affirmation.

<li>
Give me advice instead of opinions.

</ul>

<div id="How to help me"><h1 id="How to help me" class="header"><a href="#How to help me">How to help me</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
Give me feedback. If you didn't like anything I did or something I didn't do when I should have done you can tell me, text me or email me.

<li>
If you see any strange behaviour from anyone in my team, I encourage you to give feedback to the person first and then let me know. I encourage everybody to give feedback in person, but if you think I should pay more attention to something let me know.

<li>
Don't be afraid to suggest me to change my course of action, e.g. in a meeting. I'm very open to suggestions and advice.

</ul>

<div id="What people misunderstand about me"><h1 id="What people misunderstand about me" class="header"><a href="#What people misunderstand about me">What people misunderstand about me</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
At home, I speak Portuguese, not Spanish.
 &#128527;

<li>
Questions are my way to engage. If I question your idea it doesn't mean necessarily I disagree with it. I can just be the case that I want to learn more or I want you to expand your vision.

<li>
I moved to Australia with my wife (who still learning English) and two kids. I have other things to think about besides work 
 &#128521;

<li>
Although I can play guitar and sing, I struggle to do that in English. It takes me weeks to learn a new song in English, while in portuguese, I can learn multiple songs per day.
